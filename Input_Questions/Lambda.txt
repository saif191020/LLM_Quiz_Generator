Question: You are designing a serverless application that needs to process images uploaded to an S3 bucket. Each image processing task takes around 2 minutes to complete. How can you ensure that the Lambda function does not timeout during execution?
Answer: Increase the Lambda function’s timeout configuration to more than 2 minutes.
By default, Lambda functions have a timeout of 3 seconds. However, you can adjust this timeout setting to a maximum of 15 minutes. In this scenario, setting the timeout to a value greater than 2 minutes ensures that the function has enough time to process each image without being terminated prematurely.
Question:You have a Lambda function that retrieves data from a DynamoDB table and performs some calculations on it. The function is frequently timing out due to slow database queries. How can you optimize the performance of the function?
Answer: Enable provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function.
Provisioned concurrency allows you to pre-allocate a number of execution environments for your Lambda function, ensuring that it can handle sudden spikes in traffic without experiencing cold starts or delays due to resource provisioning. This can significantly improve the performance of the function, especially when interacting with slow or heavily loaded databases like DynamoDB.
